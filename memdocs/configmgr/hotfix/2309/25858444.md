# Update rollup for Microsoft Configuration Manager version 2309

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch, version 2309)*

## Summary of KB25858444
This article describes issues that are fixed in the update rollup for Microsoft Configuration Manager current branch, version 2309. This update applies both to customers who opted in through a PowerShell script to the early update ring deployment, and customers who installed the globally available release.

For more information on changes in Configuration Manager version 2309, see:

- [What’s new in version 2309 of Configuration Manager current branch](../../core/plan-design/changes/whats-new-in-version-2309.md)
- [Summary of changes in Microsoft Configuration Manager current branch, version 2309](../../hotfix/2309/24341484.md)


## Issues that are fixed

<!-- 26282398 -->
- The Configuration Manager Prerequisite Checker process fails to connect to the site SQL server after upgrading to ODBC Driver version 18.0. Errors similar to the following are recorded in the ConfigMgrPrereqCheck.log file.

  ```console
  [Microsoft][ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server]SSL Provider: The target principal name is incorrect.~~
  Client unable to establish connection
  Failed to connect to the SQL Server, connection type: SMS ACCESS
  ```

<!-- 26442806 -->
- Due to a timing issue, a double reboot can still prevent a Task Sequence from running, even when the SMSTSWaitForSecondReboot variable is set. This problem can happen during an operating system deployment, combined with an update that requires two reboots.

<!-- 26419721 -->
- The BitLocker management agent might incorrectly assign a key protector for a client when the key escrow process failed. 

<!-- 26150205 -->
- Clients might be unable to download software from a cloud management gateway (CMG) after updating to Configuration Manager 2303 or later. Errors similar to the following are recorded in the MP_Location.log file.

  ```console
  The SELECT permission was denied on the object 'vSMS_DefaultBoundaryGroup', database 'CM_{SideCode}', schema 'dbo'.
  ```

<!-- 26274868 -->
- If the BitLocker recovery key escrow process fails due to a SQL exception, such as a timeout or deadlock, the process isn't retried automatically. The SMS_Message_Processing_Engine is updated to retry these failures for BitLocker recovery keys.

<!-- 25961029 -->
- If multiple packages are uploaded to a distribution point on the same CMG instance, the upload process can fail. This scenario occurs after updating to Configuration Manager current branch, version 2303 or later.
Errors resembling the following are recorded in the pkgxfermgr.log file.

  ```console
  ERROR: Operation GetStorageAccountBlobContainerIds for StorageAccount:{name} failed with Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.StorageException: The remote server returned an error: (404) Not Found.
  ---> System.Net.WebException: The remote server returned an error: (404) Not Found.~~
  ```

<!-- 26357341 -->
- The upgrade experience indicators on the Windows 11 Readiness dashboard incorrectly list Windows 11 versions as "22H2" when they're a different version.

<!-- 26322254 --> 
- Collection updates may be delayed in large environments that collect frequently changing hardware inventory data, such as recently used applications. This occurs due to triggers on the CollectionNotifications table that run when processing hardware inventory.

This issue was first corrected on Configuration Manager current branch, version 2010, for new site installations. It's now revised to apply to existing sites.

## Hotfixes that are included in this update

- [KB 26129847](../../hotfix/2309/26129847.md): Client discovery data update for Microsoft Configuration Manager version 2309

## Update information for Microsoft Configuration Manager current branch, version 2309

This update is available in the Updates and Servicing node of the Configuration Manager console for environments that were installed by using the globally available build of version 2309.

<!-- Members of the Configuration Manager Technology Adoption Program (TAP) must first apply the private TAP rollup before this update is displayed. -->

To verify which build is in use, look for a Package GUID by adding the Package GUID column to the details pane of the Updates and Servicing node in the console. The update applies to installations from packages that have the following GUID:

- **FD3D0214-F4DC-4664-B6BB-997E381B7C9D**

### Restart information

This update doesn't require a computer restart but will initiate a [site reset](../../core/servers/manage/modify-your-infrastructure.md#bkmk_reset) after installation.

### Additional installation information

After you install this update on a primary site, pre-existing secondary sites must be manually updated. To update a secondary site in the Configuration Manager console, select **Administration** > **Site Configuration** > **Sites** >  **Recover Secondary Site**, and then select the secondary site. The primary site then reinstalls that secondary site by using the updated files. Configurations and settings for the secondary site aren't affected by this reinstallation. The new, upgraded, and reinstalled secondary sites under that primary site automatically receive this update.

Run the following SQL Server command on the site database to check whether the update version of a secondary site matches that of its parent primary site:

```sql
select dbo.fnGetSecondarySiteCMUpdateStatus ('SiteCode_of_secondary_site')
```

If the value 1 is returned, the site is up to date, with all the hotfixes applied on its parent primary site.

If the value 0 is returned, the site has not installed all the fixes that are applied to the primary site, and you should use the **Recover Secondary Site** option to update the secondary site.

| Component | Version |
